Hi!  
I'm a developer from Latvia. I'm currently working on getting my degree in Computer Science. I love learning new skills and have experimented with all the technologies and programming languages I could get my hands on. My strongest experience is with Python and website design.  
Here are some of my favorite programming projects:

I'm also interested in CAD, microelectronics, 3D animation, filmmaking, storytelling, video editing, game design, VFX, logo design, drawing, poetry, and most things creative.  
These are some of my projects:

I speak Latvian, English, and Russian, have some experience with German, and I am currently learning Spanish. I love Spanish. I'm also interested in history, paleontology, biology, astronomy, physics, politics, and economics in my free time.  
These are some of my favorite books:

I would love to work on any project that combines creativity with technology.  
Feel free to contact me on any of these platforms:
